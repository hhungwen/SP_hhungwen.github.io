    "contents": "\nProject Proposal Background\nTaiwanâ€™s house prices continue to rise since many years ago, especially in the capital city - Taipei. Taipei is a city where has more job opportunities than other cities in Taiwan. Buying a home remains unaffordable for most young Taiwanese. An average household in Taipei needs to pay two-thirds of its income for a mortgage loan. Most of the young adult who works in Taipei would buy/rent a house in neighbor cities of Taipei, and commute by car/bus/ train for 30 min to 1 hour every workday. It causes the house price in neighboring cities to continually increase.\nKeelung, the city where I currently live, is one of the neighboring cities of Taipei but also the farthest one compares to other neighboring cities. I would like to analyze the house price changes in Keelung during these five years.\nGoals\nHouse price analysis.\nOverall Price increasing?\nCounty Average house price differences, and why?\nPresold rate of new constrction projects\n\n\n\n",
